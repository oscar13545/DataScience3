"You can't say that i don't love ya
Nights cryin' thinkin' of ya
I don't understand your ways
They say true love is forever gladness
All that i feel is sadness
I don't understand your ways"
"You keep me walkin' my way back to you
You say you love me then leave me so blue
You break my heart,
Then you say that we're through
But it's o.k.
I don't understand your ways"
"What have i done to deserve this madness
All that i feel is sadness
I don't understand your ways"

You say you love me and let's start anew
You break my heart,
Then you say we're through"

In every word you say
Persuasions deceiving
But i'm wise in every way
And i know 'bout your playin'
With every guy in town
So this time i'm sayin'
You won't fool me around"
"Then you get me walkin' my way back to you
You say you love me then leave me blue
You break my heart,
Then you say that we're through.
But it's o.k.
You're no good
I don't understand your ways
One more fool just to love and groove ya
That's all that he want to do to ya"
"When I was a child
I cried on mama's shoulder
She would look at me and say:
When you grow older
You will come to know
The joy and love of one good man
Everything will come in time
If you believe it
Anything you truly want
You can echive it
Picture the love you'll find
With one good man"
"Some day a price will come your way
He'll smile at you and say
He's waited all his life
For someone like you
And if the love is real
Within you heart you'll feel
I'm yours for life
Cuz you're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one for me"
"Many years have past away since mama told me
I hadn't find a man
To love, to have and hold me
There where many men
But not of them one good man
I began to dout that I would
Find my true love
But then at one noon it happened
I found you, love
You were like a dream come true
You were that one good man"
"Some day a price will come your way
He'll smile at you and say
He's waited all his life
For someone like you
And if the love is real
Within you heart you'll feel
I'm yours for life
Cuz you're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one for me"
"It's true, I knew from that day on
My lonely days were gone
Those lonely tears I've cried
Since you are by my side
Now and forever more
You'll be with me
And we will love
You are my everything"
"When I was a child I cried
On mama's shoulder
She would look at me and say:
When you grow older
You'll find a man to love
And now I see that
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one
You're the one for me"
"You're good
You're so good"
"Every now and then i think about
What my life would be without you
You're good for me"
"I think of all the lonely days
The lonely nights i went without
You're good for me"
"If i had to do it (if i had to do it)
All over again (all over)
I'll have no life without ya
That's the way i feel about you"
"Every night i reach to touch
To know you're there is just enough
You're good for me (you're good for me)"
"It's easy now for me to say
But things could have turned out a different way
You're good for me"
"If i had to do it (if i had to do it)
All over again (all over)
I'll have no life without ya
That's the way i feel about you
Don't ya, don't ya, don't ya, don't ya

"You were there, before we came
You took the hurt, you took the shame
They built the walls to block your way
You beat them down
You won the day
It wasn't right, it wasn't fair
You taught them all
You made them care
Yes, you were there, and thanks to you
There's now a door we all walk through
And we are here, for all to see
To be the best that we can be
Yes, I am here
Because you were there"

When I come of age"
"My folks say I'm too young for love
But they don't seem to understand

A feeling I understand
And while I've got this feeling
It's you, girl, you're so grand
And I'll love you girl just as strong
When I become a age"

For three long years
When no one else wanted you
I took you in and held you near"

After you said you'd always stay
How could you be so mean and untrue?
He didn't want you until he'd seen
What my love did for you, yeah"
"Oh baby, what goes around, comes around
I knew he'd soon be gone
Yeah baby, he put you down, now you're the clown
And you want me to come back home"
"I've had no love affairs
For three long years
Remember how I used to care
When you were down, I dried your tears"
"Who did you think was the fool?
I let you treat me so cruel
This is the moment of truth for you
Do you think your playing is through?
I don't think I can trust you"
"Oh baby, what goes around, comes around
I knew he'd soon be gone
Yeah baby, he put you down, now you're the clown
And you want me to come back home?"

"Love was taken from a young life
And no one told her why
Her direction has a dim light
From one more violent crime"
"She innocently questioned why
Why her father had to die
She asked the men in blue
How is it that you get to choose
Who will live and who will die?
Did God say that you could decide?
You saw he did not run
And that my daddy had no gun"
"In the middle of a village
Way in a distant land
Lies a poor boy with his broken toy
Too young to understand"
"He's awaken, ground is shaking
His father grabs his hand
Screaming, crying, his wife's dying
Now he's left to explain"
"He innocently questioned why
Why his mother had to die
What did these soldiers come here for?
If they're for peace, why is there war?
Did God say that they could decide
Who will live and who will die?
All my mama ever did
Was try to take care of her kids"
"We're innocently standing by
Watching people lose their lives
It seems as if we have no voice
It's time for us to make a choice
Only God could decide
Who will live and who will die
There's nothing that cannot be done
If we raise our voice as one"
"They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough"

Deep in your soul and let God decide
(Deep in my soul)
It's up to me and I am still alive
They've gotta hear it from us, oh
We can't take it
We've already had enough"
"It's going down, baby
(Just let God decide)
It's going on, baby

Deep in my soul baby
We've already had enough"
"They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't, we can't
We've already had enough
You're my lover
We've already had enough"
"They've gotta hear it from me, in the dark from me
As my brother, it's too much from me
As my brother, baby
As my lover
We've already had enough, oh"
"Oh Lord, oh Lord
Deep in my soul, baby
Oh, no
Why did you do it?

"When the radio isn't on you can hear the songs
A guided light on the dark road your walking on
A sign post to find the dreams you thought was gone
Someone to help you move the obstacles you stumbled on
Someone to help you rebuild after the rubble's gone
We are the world connected by a common bond
Love the whole planet sing it along"

"Tonight's story is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introducing
A monster had arrived in the village
The major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown
And this person or thing is soon to be met
He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion
Oh yes, I did forget something didn't I? 
I forgot to introduce you to the monster"
"You're fearing me, 'cause you know I'm a beast
Watching you when you sleep, when you're in bed I'm underneath
You're trapped in halls, and my face is the walls
I'm the floor when you fall, and when you scream it's 'cause of me
I'm the living dead, the dark thoughts in your head
I heard just what you said
That's why you've got to be threatened by me"
"You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me"
"You think you're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you
Your worst nightmare, it's me, I'm everywhere
In one blink I'll disappear, and then I'll come back to haunt you
I'm telling you, when you lie under a tomb
I'm the one watching you
That's why you got to be threatened by me"

Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me"
"The unknown monster is about to embark
From a far corner, out of the dark
A nightmare, that's the case
Never Neverland, that's the place
This particular monster can read minds
Be in two places at the same time
This is judgement night, execution, slaughter
The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture
You can be sure of one thing, that's fate
A human presence that you feel is strange
A monster that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing to fear"
"You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened

Ten years ago on this day
My heart was yearning
I promised I would never ever be returning
Where my baby broke my heart
And left me yearning"
"As we walked into the room
There were faces
Staring, glaring, tearing through me
Someone said welcome to your doom
Then they smiled with eyes
That looked as if they knew me
This is scaring me"

Still concealing gloom
There were two girls sitting in my room
She walked up to my face
And said this is the place
You said meet you right here at noon"
"This is Heartbreak hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak hotel
So this is Heartbreak hotel
This place is Heartbreak hotel"

She thought that I had cheated for another lover
I turn my back to see that I am undercover
Now I can't convince this girl there ain't no other"

Every smile's a trial thought in beguile
To hurt me (this is scaring me)
Then the man next door had told
He's been here in tears for fifteen years
This is scaring me"

And found that wicked women run this strange hotel
There was Sefra and Sue
Every girl that I knew
And my baby said love is through"

(Killer, thriller)"
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
"Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell"

"The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grizzly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller"

I am forever
Wasn't it I who said that you are free?
When living seemed so hard to be
And things would hurt you"

We need each other, we'll never part
Our love is from the heart
We'll never say: I don't need you
We are forever"

When things are shady, what comes what may we do get by

"There's a man
Who plays the game of life so well
There's such a man
His thoughts you can never tell
And it's just the way he thought it would be
'Cause the day has come for him to be free
Then he laughs, he kicks and rolls up his sleeves"

This is the man

This is the man"

Everybody thought they knew
There's such a man
He's not like me and you

I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man
Did you know - this man can do anything?
There's such a man
I wish that we could bring
And it's just the way he thought it would be
'Cause the day has come for him to be free
Then he laughs, he kicks and rolls up his sleeves
I'm alive and I'm here forever
This is the man"

You'll be out in the world, 
Such a pretty girl, 
But you'll be on your own"

Too cool for criticism

'Cause I'm the captain
I'm in a body from hell
I'm shivering, quivering
I smile while I'm delivering
Get some love and passion
It's never been
So intense and spiritual like
In sense of above, against
And all off in silence
Then I scream like a man
Out of his rich
'Cause I'm so serious
So serious effecting"

"I sing of what you see and might think about
Because of what you see
Moving hands, mobile faces
Where by the eye not the ear traces
What's on the mind"
"So when you see hands
Weaving the space between friends
Think of them as being
As though you were seeing voices"
"Speech without sound
Face to face, hands unbound
Weaving the space between friends
So, think of them as being
As though you were seeing voices"
"Believe it they ramble on exactly as we would
And talking with someone we know
And even they stumble on expressions as we would
And talking with anyone"
So
"When you see hands weaving
The space between friends
Think of them as telling or asking
Or spelling out choices
So think of hands as being
As though you were seeing voices"
"So when you see hands
Weaving the space between friends
Think of them as being
As though you were seeing voices"
"Speech without sound
Face to face, hands unbound
Weaving the space between friends

"So think of hands as asking or telling
Or spelling out choices
Just think of hands as being
As though you were seeing, voices"
"Just think of hands as being
As though you were seeing
Voices, voices

"Alone she lies waiting
Surrounded by gloom
Invaded by shadows
Painting the room
The light from the window
Cuts through the air
And pins the child lying there
Scared of the moon"
"She pulls up the covers
And shivers in fright
She hides from the color
That rides on the night
The light through the window
That lights up the sky
And causes her mournful cry
Scared of the moon"
"There's nothing wrong
Don't be bothered they said
It's just childish fantasies turning your head
No need to worry
It's really too soon
But there she lies shivering
Scared of the moon"
"Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon"
"The years go by swiftly
And soon childhood ends
But life is still fearful
When evening descends
The fear of a child
Still intrudes the night
Returning on beams of light
Scared of the moon"
"The feeling of terror
She felt as a youth
Has turned from a fantasy
Into the truth
The moon is the enemy
Twisting her soul
And taking its fearful toll
Scared of the moon"
"But now there are others who sit in a room
And wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom
Together they gather
Their lunacy shade
But knowing just why they're scared
Scared of the moon"
"Scared of the Moon
Scared of the Moon
Scared of the Moon
Scared of the Moon"
"Save me...
Save me..."
"She's not a star
But she'll go far
So she's telling all her friends
She's only young and just begun
To see clearly
In her eyes"
"Nothing turned out like she thought it would
(Thought it would)
And I was waiting right there where she stood"
"She said: save me
From this wicked world I'm livin' in
She said: save me

She said: save me
(Save me, girl)
She said save me...
Ooh!"
"All on her own
She's on the phone
So sincerely...
Ooh... makin' a joke
There's no reply
She wonders why
And pays the rent one more time"

(On the take)
And I was there when she began to brake

"Ah I feel a fountain in my brain
Ice-cold water runnin' through my pain
Got a bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears
Heart so sad 'cause love's gone bad"
"I see a rainbow all in black
Must be a sign that you ain't comin' back
Wake up at night callin' your name
I see a face on my window pane
I've been this way since you've been gone
Without your love I can't go on
Look in the mirror, what do I see? 
A cryin' face, kinda looks like me
Now where's the love you promised me? 
Where's he tenderness to comfort me?"
"Everytime some love I choose
I seem to always be the one to lose
Bad taste in my mouth from bitter tears
Heart fells sad 'cause love's gone bad
Love's gone bad, heart fells bad"
"Black crows flying up above
It's a sign that I live life without love
Slime's on the man, slime's ont the sea
Slime's everywhere I said I'm destined to be
And this world where nothing's right
Since you've been gone I can't sleep at night
You said you'd be true to me
Instead you made a fool out of me
Heart feels sad, love's gone bad"
"And oh my darling, now you're gone
       Love is here
       And oh my darling, now you're gone
       You persuaded me to love you
       And I did
       But instead of tenderness
       I found heartache instead
       Into your arms I fell
       So unaware of the loneliness
       Thar was waiting there"
"You closed the door to your heart, girl
       And you turned the key
       Locked your love away from me"
"Love is here
       And oh my darling, now you're gone
       You made me love you
       And oh my darling, now you're gone
       You said loving you
       Would make life beautiful
       With each passing day
       But as soon as love came
       Into my heart
       You turned and you walked
       Just walked away"
"You stripped me of my dreams
       You gave me faith, then you took my hope
       Look at me now"
"Look at me
       See what loving has done to me
       Look at my face
       See how cryin' has left its trace
       After you made me all your own
       Then you left me all alone
       You made your words sound so sweet
       Knowing that your love I couldn't keep"
"My heart cries out for your touch
       But baby, you're not there
       And the lonely cry fades in the air"
"Love is here
       And oh my darling, now you're gone
       Love is here
       And oh my darling, now you're gone
       You made me love you
       Oh oh my darling, now you're gone
       Talking 'bout love, love, love, love,
       Ooh ooh my darling, now you're gone"
"Lookin' through the window
Lookin' through the window (ah)
Lookin' through the window
Look look look through the window
(oh ah)
Lookin' through the window"
"Lookin' through the windows
The window to your heart (oh baby yeah)
I can see its cloudy
The rain's about to start"
"Lookin' through the windows (lookin' through the windows)
It seems i've caused your fears (yea yea yea)
And that little doubt girl (and your little doubt girl)
And now it's bringin' tears (and its bringin' tears)"
Remember
"Just remember what ever makes you feel that way
Don't you worry 'cause i'm gonna stay
Right by your side (by your side)
To keep on lookin' through the windows
Lookin' in you eyes
(ooh lookin' in your eyes, eyes, eyes)
(lookin, lookin' in your eyes, eyes, eyes)"
"Lookin' through the windows (lookin' through the windows)
Seems like the only way (yeah)
I can know your feelings
If you still love me today"
Remember

"Lonely teardrops, my pillow nerver dries
Lonely teardrops, come home, come home
Just say you will, just say you will, say you will
My heart is cryin', cryin'"
"Just give me another chance for a romance
Come on and tell me when do you return
'Cause everybody that you been gone away
You know my heart does nothin' but burn, cry"
"Lonely teardrops, my pillow nerver dries
Lonely teardrops, come home, come home
Just say you will, just say you will, say you will
My heart is cryin', cryin'"
"I watch the snowflakes fall
against my window plain
and wonder if you
are watchin snowflakes too
I take a walk downtown
to where you used to meet me
Theres joy everywhere
but all that waiting there is"
"[Chorus]
Just a little christmas tree
Lookin sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on christmas eve'"
"I hear the Christmas bells
(Bum Bum Bum)
The happy people singing
The songs of the chill that only brings me tears
I sadly close my eyes
and say a liitle prayer
you'll be waiting there for me
I look but all I see is"
[Chorus]
"This is the season of love
(This is the season of love)
But I'm as sad as I can be
(sad as can be)
Why did you have to leave me
(Why did you leave me)
(Why did you leave me)"
[Chorus]
"You and me
We've traded hearts
I guess that's how
It always starts out
And then I guess it always ends"
"Look at us
(Now)
Sayin'
I don't think that you and me
Can just be friends
Maybe this is how the whole thing
Has to just end"
"And if we could
Have loved enough
(La la dee, la la dee dah dah, la la dah, la la dah, la la dah,
la...)
We would have handled
When it got rough
But one of us let go too soon"
"So here we are
(Here we are)
Now sayin'
I don't think that you and me
Can just be friends
Maybe this is how the whole thing
Has to just end"
I wish you'd understand...
"It's funny how
When love has gone
There's only one left holdin' on
When someone's always hurtin' more
Still lonely for the other"
"Sayin'
I don't think that you and me
Can just be friends
(Hmm...)
I don't ever wanna feel so much again
Feel again...
Unless it's you..
You... again"
"(La la dee, la la dee dah dah, la la dah, la la dah, la la dah,
la...)
I guess that's how it always starts out
And then I guess
It always ends"
"Look at us
(Look at us)
(Now)
Now sayin'
I don't think that you and me
Can just be friends
(Hmm...)
Maybe this is how the whole thing
Has to just end?"
"La la dee, la la dee dah dah, la la dah, la la dah, la la dah,
la..."

How can you cage a bird
Born to be wild"

J'aimerais prononcer que toi, que toi 
Ce que je ressens 
Personne ne comprend 
Je me sens si bien de t'aimer 
Pour la première fois 
Je sais que c'est toi 
J'ai besoin de rêver 
Je vais t'emmener"
"L'été finira 
Près du feu de bois 
On fera l'amour 
Blottie contre toi 
Je te dirai tout bas 
Tu me rends folle 
Ce que je ressens personne ne comprend 
Je me sens si bien près de toi 
J'en perd ma fierté 
Je ne veux plus tricher 
La vérité pour moi 
C'est la vie avec toi"

Sans toi c'est un enfer 
Ne t'en vas pas 
Et pouvoir t'embrasser 
J'en tremble rien d'y penser 
Tout te donner 
Les femmes d'avant toi 
Ne comptent même pas 
J'ai oublié tout ton passé 
Le terre pous trembler 
La guerre éclater 
Je supporterai tout 
Écoute-moi mon amour"

Il m'a vraiment tout apporté 
Donne-moi ton corps et ton âme 
Pour te dire amour, toujours, je veux te garder"

Je ne veux pas la fin de nous 
Et si ca stoppe 
Je crois que je deviendrais fou 
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous"
"Miles away, oceans apart
never been my sight always in my heart
the love is always there it will never die
only growing stronger tears down my eye
I am thinking all the time
when the day will come
standing there before you
accept this Hajj of mine
standing in ihram, making my tawaf
drinking blessings from your well
the challenges that I have suffered
rekindles my imaan
O Allah! I am waiting for the call
praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall
O Allah! I am waiting for the call
praying for the day when I can be near Your Kabah wall
I feel alive and I feel strong
I can feel Islam running in my Veins
to see my Muslim brothers, their purpose all the same
greeting one another, exalting one True Name
I truly hope one day that everyone's a Muslim.
that they remember you in everything they say
standing in ihram making my tawaf, making my tawaf
drinking blessings from your well
the challenges that I have suffered
rekindles my imaan
O Allah! I am waiting for the call
praying for the day when I can be near the Kabah wall
O Allah! I am waiting for the call
praying for the day when I can be near Your Kabah wall"

"Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today
In our small way"
"Empty words are not enough
Where there's hurt we'll be a crush
When there's thirst we'll fill each other's cup
Because we care, we love enough to share"
"Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today
In our small way"

And the prayer that frees the soul
We'll be there to share each lonely road

Love is all we need"

In our small way"
"If'n I was God
Well just for spite
I woulddn't set the sun at night
'Til everyone was treated right
By everyone else they see"
"If'n I was God
I'd fix it so without explaining
Folks would know, they'd know
What's going on inside
Of everyone else like me"
"Nobody hurt nobody else
Oh no I wouldn't let it be
Nobody have a need to pray
Except for thanking me"
"If'n I was God
I'd make us wise
So everyone could realise
That everywhere beneath the sun
Everyone needs, everyone"
"And God that in heaven what I would do
If'n I was you
If'n I was God
Love each other, reach out
And touch somebody's hand"
"I have seen love make men stagger
Praying their weakness and wound
Their pride
But you won't be touched by its dagger"
"When you're close by my side
If you'd only believe
Ooh, ooh, ooh
If you'd only believe
Ooh, ooh, ooh"

Sail the shining deep blue sea

Ooh, ooh, ooh"

And if the skly comes
Tumbling down
Raining too hard for you to see
That's the time when you need"

And who's got a shoulder like me?
Can you tell me what you're feeling now
Open your heart so you can see
In this world there are so many ways"
"We can get what we need
Ooh, ooh, ooh
If you'd only believe
Ooh, ooh, ooh"
"What your love means to me
Why should the slky come
Falling down
Why should it rain on you and me
Just remember when you need
Someone around"
"Who loves you more than me?
Ooh, ooh, ooh
If you'd only believe
Ooh, ooh, ooh"
"Whether I'm right or whether I'm wrong
Whether I find a place in this world or never belong
I've gotta be me, I've gotta be me
What else can I be but what I am?"
"I want to live, not merely survive
And I won't give up this dream of life that keeps me alive
I've gotta be me, I've gotta be me
The dreams that I see makes me what I am"
"That far away prize, a world of success
Is waiting for me if I heed the call
I won't settle down, won't settle for less
As long as there's a chance that I can have it all"
"I'll done it alone, that's how it must be
I can't be right for somebody else if I'm not right for me
I've gotta be free, I've gotta be free
Daring to try, to do it or die I've gotta be me"
"I'll done it alone, that's how it must be

I'd never leave for a minute
But things don't always turn out
The way we want them to
So while I'm away
I want you to remember
How much I love you
I love you, I love you"
"Let this love lift you up
Whne you're feelin' blue
Wherever I go, I will be loving you
Think of me when you see
Places we once shared
Whatever I do, someday I'll need you there"
"Wherever I go, whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you
Even though we both know
You're not in my arms
Wherever I go, you're always in my heart"
"Just you ask, I'll come back
Though we're miles apart
Whatever I do, I'll come to where you are
Wherever I go, whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you
Wherever I go, whatever I do
I'll always come home
I'll come home to you"
"I was born in Lil' Rock,
Had a childhood sweetheart,
We were always hand in hand."
"I was hightop shoes and shirt tails,
Suzy was in pig tails,
I know I loved her even then."
"You know my papa disapproved it,
My mama boohooed it,
But I told them time and time again,
"Don't you know I was made to love her,
Built a world all around her"
Yah! Hey, hey, hey."
"She's been my inspiration,
Showed appreciation
For the love I gave her through the years."
"Like a sweet magnolia tree
My love blossmed tenderly,
My life grew sweeter through the years."
"I know that my baby loves me,
My baby needs me,
That's why we made it through the years."

Our love just won't end,
'Cause I love my baby, love my baby. Ah!"
"My baby loves me,
My baby needs me,
And I know I ain't going nowhere."
"I was knee high to a chicken
When that love bug bit me,
I had the fever with each passing year."
"Oh, even if the mountain tumbles,
If this whole world crumbles,
By her side I'll still be standing there."
"'Cause I was made to love her,
I was made to live for her, yeah!"
"Ah, I was made to love her,
Built my world all around her,
Hey, hey, hey."

My baby needs me,
Hey, hey, hey."
Oo my baby loves me...
"This is it
Here I stand
In the light of the world
Love is grand
And this love
I can feel
And I know
Yes, for sure
It is real"
"And it seems as though
I've seen your face a thousand times
And you know
That you've seen my face before
And you said that you don't want me
To come around
But many times
I'm gonna do it to this love"
"Ooh, yeah

Falling in love wasn't my plan
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on, please, baby
I'm trustin'"
"This is it
Here I stand
With you I've got the world in my hands
And this love
That I feel
Yes, I know
That's for sure
This is real"

Never felt this way before
I look at you
And I can't believe the love I found
And I know
That I can never want for more"

(Your command)
This love
That I feel

Never thought it could feel so real"
"I can feel you turn the key
That free my broken heart
Now I'm not afraid to love
Against some odds
And you're everything I know
That I can want and more
But I really didn't know it until now
No, no"
"I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan
I never thought that I would be your lover

You see, you see
I never heard, I never heard
I never heard, I never heard
About you"
"I need you, girl
I couldn't live a day without you
Well I tried to write a special song
A love song just for you
To explain the way you make me feel inside
Though the meaning may be simple
And the words may not be new
I couldn't make it clearer if I tried
I need you
And I couldn't live a day without you
I need you
More than anyone could ever know
I need you
And I wanna build my world around you
I need you
I need you
Well I sang the words and realized
It'd all been said before
So I tried a different line that meant the same
But it didn't have the feeling
And the first one said much more
So I guess I'll have to say it once again
I need you
And I couldn't live a day without you
I need you
More than anyone could ever know
(More than anyone could ever know)
I couldn't live a day without you, girl
I need you and I wanna build my world around you

A love song just for you
I need you"
"Your givin me true love
And everyday I thank the lord
For a feeling that's so new
So inviting so exciting"
"Whenever your near
I hear a symphony
A tender melody
Pulling me closer, closer to your arms
Then suddenly your lips are touching mine
A feeling so divine, still I need a path because
I'm lost in a world
Made for you and me
Oooh..."
"Baby, Baby

Ooooh... baby"
"Whenever your near
I hear a symphony
Played sweet and tenderly
Everytime your lips meet mine, my baby"

Don't let this feeling end
Let it go on and on and on now baby"
"Baby, baby
Those tears that filled my eyes
I cried not for myself
But for those who have never felt the joy of love"
"Baby, baby
Whenever your near
I hear a symphony
Each time you speak of me
I hear a tender note so sweet of love"
"Baby, baby
As you stand there holding me
Whispering how much you care
A thousand violins fill the air, now"
"Baby, baby
Don't let this moment end
Keep standing close to me
So close to me my baby, baby, baby"
"Baby, baby
I hear a symphony
A tender melody
I hear a symphony"

Feeling the world standing still
Watch raindbows glow rest on a bed of flowers

Knowing no ills, needing no pills
Singing a rock and roll hymn
Feeling glorious, full of love
Fine from the start
You can close your eyes
And see the world with your heart"

Living the way that you choose
Healthly and clean
Can't understand anyone having the blues

How great to give love without invitation

Lying on a bed of leaves
In the modern times
You forget and let your spirit breathe"

Another vitim of your ritual
For you my skin is shed
Ecstacy ain't what you find
In the modern world
One flick of my tongue changes
The meaning of the world
And you say
That's impossible
That's not impossible to do, oh
And you digest what I can see
The taste of you can be"
"Chorus:
I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cause you're so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust, you see
I don't wanna get eaten alive
To be eaten alive
Eaten alive
I don't ever wanna be
Eaten alive"
"Now I got you on the run
And the quicker my senses
And the chance is, I'm the faster one
I know the universal law
Primeval times
With a little stimulation
It'll come once more, and you say
That's impossible
It's not impossible to do, oh
And you digest what I can see
The taste of you can be"

"I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cause you're so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust, you see

You can rip my shirt, drag me in the dirt
I will be your slave, anything you say
I don't ever wanna be eaten alive"
"I don't wanna get eaten alive
'Cos you're so dangerous
No more hearts I can trust, you see
I don't wanna get eaten alive

Though it's impossible, for us together
Oh it's not real, a love I can't feel"
"Guess I'll always be a dreamer
Dreaming my life away, dreaming my life away

Dreaming my life away, dreaming my life away
And nothing comes but sleep, to a dreamer
And when you wake up the dream is gone away"

When all else fails, nothin' else left to do

Listen to the kick drum, kickin' along
Yeah, Lisa likes jazz, she's their number one fan

Made you brought up in her life right

And every time you see her walk by
Stop thinking bout your night life
She all that's in your eyesight
And ever since the first day you seen her thinking she the white
Type
You figure she'll be perfect loving you
Fantasize a single from her fingers rubbing you
Trying to analyze the situation
You feeling crazy
Wonderin' forever what's so special bout this lady
Feeling like you wanna pull back
But you know you perfect for her you got all of what them fools
Lack
Maybe you should make this thing happen
Brandies and things swinging on the porch while the kids napping
You got everything else you need
Snatch her up fill that empty space she can make your life
Complete"
"All you gotta do is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile when I try to say hello to you, yeah
And all you gotta do is not answer my calls when I'm trying to
Get through
Keep me wondering why, when all I can do is sigh I just wanna
Touch you"
"I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I"
"All I gotta say is that I must be dreaming, can't be real
You're not here with me, still I can feel you near me
I caress you, let you taste us, just so blissful listen
I would give you anything baby, just make my dreams come true
Oh baby you give me butterflies"
"I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I"
"(Eve Rap)
You like the way you stop the way that she got you hot
Excited said you need what she got
Enticing Mami like the cream of the crop
Pressure getting heavy bout to make your heart pop
All your life you waited for this chick
Nobody told you it'd feel like this
Do anything just to feel that kiss
Wanna give her whatever you got
In front of millions making on whatever the plot"
"If you would take my hand, baby I will show you
Guide you to the light babe
If you would be my love, baby I will love you, love you
'Til the end of time"
"I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I"
"I'd like to be yours
Tomorrow
So I'm giving you some time
To think it over today"
"But you can't take my blues away
No matter what you say, hey
You can't take my blues away
No matter what you say
What you say, hey, babe"
"Hey, babe
What's your thinking
No darlin'
It won't, won't change my mind"
"But you can't take my blues away
Now tell me what you say, babe
You can't take my blues away
No matter what you say
What you say, hey, babe"
"This way I feel
I know that's it's true
Because it's for you
You know that it's true
But you try to be
Hard to resist
I ask what it's for
You know you close the door
(No no, no no)
Yeah
(No no, no no)
Tell me what you say, babe
Say, yeah, babe
You can't take my blues away
Tell me what you say
What you say, yeah, babe"
"I've got the power
Doin' it out
Say anything
'Cause I've got this feeling
Say I

Come on
Yeah
Come on"
"Alone tonight
Me here tonight
Till it's all right
Damn lover friend of mine"
"She got your number, she know your game
She put you under, it's so insane
Since you seduced her, how does it feel
To know that woman is out to kill?"
"Susie got your number, and Susie ain’t your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number, and Susie says it's right"
"Susie says it's, Su-Su says it's
(Take my-take my money)
Susie got your, Su-Susie got your
(Throw my time away)
Blood is on, is on, blood is
(You've been talking garbage)
The dance floor, the dance the night
(You're damn, damn good for me)"
"I never knew, but I was walking the line
Come, go with me, I said I have no time
And don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone
My baby cried, she left me standing alone"
"Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
This is Heartbreak Hotel, it's so evil
Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel"
"10 years ago today
Dangerous, and Susie ain’t your friend
Dangerous, with seven inches in
Dangerous, blood is on the knife
Dangerous, and Susie says it's right"
"A haunting ghostly treat, the foolish trickery
And spirits dancing in the night
But if you came to see the truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart"
"So just leave me alone, girl
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl
Leave me alone
Stop it, just stop dogging me around"
"It was blood on the dance floor, to enjoy that simple dance
It was blood on the dance floor, everything was on my side
It was blood on the dance floor, like it was love and true romance
It was blood on the
And I just can't take it, the girl won't break it"
"You've been, you've been, you don't, you don't, don't
You don't, you don't, don't mess with my baby
She don't, she don't, she don't know it
She just, she just, mess with my baby"
"I try to do what's right for me
But no one sees the way I see
And then I try to please them so
But how far can this pleasing go"
"Somethings soon to come over you
You just can't please the world and yourself
You gotta start doing whats right for you
Cause life is being happy yourself"
"Then you should bless his soul
It's hard to find
A person like you
You're one of a kind
If I were you, I'd change my mind
And start living for me in these changing times"
"Sometimes I cry cause I'm confused
Is this a fact of being used
There is no life for me at all
Cause I give myself at beck and call"
"Somethings soon to come over you
You just can't please the world and yourself
You gotta start doing what's right for you
Cause life is being happy yourself"

Doggone dangerous, dangerous, dangerous"

It's hard to find
A person like you
You're one of a kind
People will cry
If rain or sun
Try to please all
And you've pleased none"
"Hah!
Go!
Yea, girl
Aaow!"
"She drinks to your mind
She drinks 'til you faint
You walk in the line
She's making you stay
She's keeping the count
She's making you pay
She's ready again
Get ready again"
"She needs you, boy
She wants you, boy
She haunts you, boy
Don't you see she got me thinking"
"Black widow woman (you're dirty, baby)
In a web of seduction (stop lying, baby)
She's a lucky filled woman
She has something to say (you're dirty, you're nasty)
(You ain't no friend of mine)
She's the one, the one for me"
"She fed you a line
You brought it this time
Connecting the dots
You wouldn't decline
The look in her eyes
You're telling me so
The truth is a lie
The truth is untold"

She wants you, boy (yeah!)
She haunts you, boy
You, you, you, got you, baby"

"People always told me be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
Be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth"
Yeah, ah, ahã
"She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Gonna dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round"
"She told me her name was Bllie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Gonna dance on the floor in the round"

She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son"
"For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
Gonna dance on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice)"
"She told my baby that's a threat
As she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cries
Eyes would like mine
Gonna dance on the floor in the round, baby"

People always told me be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts

Always, please be not always
And if always, bow our heads in blame

To have nothing, to dream something, then lose hoping
Is not life but lame?

Research lies in progress to become"

Oh, so beatiful to me
Her eyes shined like stars
As she revealed herself to me"
"She never said a word
As she smiled and danced for me
And then she disappeared
Now I'm left with memories"
"I know this must sound strange
But I'm trying to explain
How an angel came to me
Oh, an angel came
Yes, she did"

And her timing so divine
I knew this was a dream
But could this girl be mine?
Maybe I'm just a fool
But sometimes dreams do come true
I'm hopelessly in love
With someone I never knew"

Still, I'm trying to explain
How an angle came to me"

Don't you run away
I got premonition (I used to dream)
Ooh, girl, it burns just like the sun"

Come on be my girl
I wanna be with mine
Ain't nobody's business
Ain't nobody's business
But mine and my baby's
(Ooh)"
"Britney Spears, ladies and gentleman
Thank you

"We pray for our fathers, pray for our mothers
Wishing our families well
We sing songs for the wishing, of those who are kissing
But not for the missing"
[Chorus 1]
"So this one's for all the lost children
This one's for all the lost children
This one's for all the lost children, wishing them well
And wishing them home"
"When you sit there addressing, counting your blessings
Biding your time
When you lay me down sleeping and my heart is weeping
Because I'm keeping a place"
[Chorus 2]
"For all the lost children
This is for all the lost children
This one's for all the lost children, wishing them well
And wishing them home"
"Home with their fathers,
Snug close and warm, loving their mothers
I see the door simply wide open
But no one can find thee"
[Chorus 3]
"So pray for all the lost children
Let's pray for all the lost children
Just think of all the lost children, wishing them well
This is for all the lost children
This one's for all the lost children
Just think of all the lost children
Wishing them well, and wishing them home"

"All the colors of the world should be
Lovin' each other wholeheartedly
Yes, it's all right
Take my message to your brother and tell him twice
Spread the word and try to teach the man
Who is hating his brother when hate won't do
'Cuz we're all the same

"Can you feel it

This happened much too soon

Boy is that girl with you

Girl, when the going gets mean"
"It's black, it's white
Yes we're one and the same, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's black, it's white
Yes we're one and the same
It's black, it's white
Yes we're one and the same, yeah, yeah, yeah
I said if you're thinkin' of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white"
"Never have I ever been so sure
(Oh, no, now)
Never thought I'd see you walk in that door
(Oh, now, yeah)
I can make you feel (like you're a queen)
No remedies (no compromise)
Would you rather be, right here with me
I want you right here next to me"
"Do you really wanna stay?
(We can take it slow)
Do you wanna walk away
(If you let it go)
Girl I'm writing you this letter just to say goodbye
I'll be standing in the rain, in case you change your mind
Do you really wanna stay?
(We can take it slow)
Do you really wanna go?
(If you let it go)
So I'm writing you this letter just to say goodbye
I'll be standing in the rain, in case you change your mind"
"She never thought she'd be here waiting on me
(Oh, no, now)
I'd never thought I'd be here back in my ways
When you're in need
Your fantasy (all here with me)
Would you rather be, right here with me
Girl, get into me"
"Anything, oh anything
To chase the rain goodbye
When you left with all your dreams
I couldn't say goodnight
She was contagious, she was contagious
She was my baby
Te quiero, I love you
Say goodbye, say goodbye"
"Don't go away
Stay by my side
Stay by my side"
"Never try to talk about it
It's got to sound good to me inside
I just think about it"
"I'm so undemanding
'Cause they say love is blind
I've lived this life pretending
I can bear this hurt deep inside"
"The truth is that I'm longing
For love that's so divine
I've searched this whole world wishing
She'll be there time after time"
"So someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out a heart that needs your love"
"I've lived my life the lonely
A soul that cries of shame
With handicapped emotions
Save me now from what still remains"

A serenading ryne
I'm just needing that someone
Save me now from the path I'm on..."
"Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
'Cause all I do is hand out a heart that needs your love
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out a heart that needs your love"
"When you say we will dance 'til the light of day
It's just like the children in earth's joy
When we pray will you promise me you'll always stay
It's because I'm needing that someone"
"Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
'Cause all I do is hand out a heart that needs your love
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out
Love"
"Who's watching?
Tell me, who's watching?
Who's watching me?"
"I'm just an average man with an average life
I work from nine to five, hey, hell, I pay the price"
"All I want is to be left alone in my average home
But why do I always feel like I'm in the Twilight zone and?"
"I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy (ooh, ooh)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream?"
"When I come home at night
I bolt the door real tight
People call me on the phone, I'm trying to avoid
But can the people on TV see me or am I just paranoid?"
"When I'm in the shower I'm afraid to wash my hair
'Cause I might open my eyes and find someone standing there
People say I'm crazy, just a little touched
But maybe showers remind me of Psycho too much"
That's why
"I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy (ooh, ooh)
I always feel like somebody's watching me
Who's playing tricks on me?"
"I don't know anymore
Are the neighbors watching me?
(Who's watching?)"
"Well, is the mailman watching me?
(Tell me who's watching?)"
"And I don't feel safe anymore, oh, what a mess
I wonder who's watching me now (who?), the IRS?
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy (ooh, ooh)"
"I always feel like somebody's watching me
Tell me is it just a dream?
I always feel like somebody's watching me
And I have no privacy (ooh, ooh)

"Heard he grew up in Queens,
Got a bullet to the brain,
Dug a step into fame,
But that don't mean a thing,
Said he'd rather be king,
With an absolute reign,
'Till he finds himself a victim of the game,
(He was stabbing her back, as a matter of fact)
Then his life became serious,"
"Marchin' like the soldier,
Marchin' like a soldier boy,
Show you the things that make a man a king,
Marchin' like the soldier,
Marchin' like a soldier boy,
Why don't you shine like you're the man again"
"People say that you're blind,
Then they say that you're fine,
But they won't help you find,
Find the road again,
If they won't help you fight
So they torture your mind
Then leave you delirious (hee hee hee), Oh my"
"Marchin' like the soldier,
Marchin' like a soldier boy,
Show you the things that make a man a king,

"Ignorance of people purchasing diamonds and necklaces
And barely able to keep the payments up on their lessons
And enrolled in a class and don't know who the professor is
How low people go for the dough and make a mess of things
Kids are murdering other kids for the fun of it
Instead of using their mind or their fist, they put a gun in it
Wanna be a part of a clique, don't know who's running it
Tragedy on top of tragedy you know it's killing me"
"So many people in agony, this shouldn't have to be
Too busy focusing on ourselves and not His Majesty
There has to be some type of change for this day and age
We gotta rearrange and flip the page
Living encaged like animals and cannibals
Eating each other alive just to survive the nine to five
Every single day is trouble while we struggle and strive
Peace of mind's so hard to find."
"I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about
All this makes me wanna shout
You know it makes me wanna shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about
All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now"
"Problems, complications and accusations
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces
A war is taking place
No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace
Is increasing the height of your spirituality
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion
How we're living
The clock is ticking, the end is coming, there'll be no warning
But we live to see the dawn"
"How can we preach, when all we make this world to be
Is a living hell torturing our minds
We all must unite, to turn darkness to light
And the love in our hearts will shine"
"We're disconnected from love, we're disrespecting each other
Whatever happened to protecting each other
Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure
But the damage that you've done is gonna last forever.
Babies being born in the world already drug addicted and
afflicted
Family values are contradicted
Ashes to ashes and dust to dust, the pressure is building and
I've had enough"
"I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about
All this makes me wanna shout
You know it makes me wanna shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about
All this makes me wanna shout, c'mon now"

"Planet Earth, my home, my place
A capricious anomaly in the sea of space
Planet Earth are you just
Floating by, a cloud of dust
A minor globe, about to bust
A piece of metal bound to rust
A speck of matter in a mindless void
A lonely spacship, a large asteroid"
"Cold as a rock without a hue
Held together with a bit of glue
Something tells me this isn't true
You are my swweetheart soft and blue
Do you care, have you a part
In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul."
"In my veins I've felt the mystery
Of corridors of time, books of hisotry
Life songs of ages throbbing in my blood
Have danced the rhythm of the tide and flood
Your misty clouds, your electric storm
Were turbulent tempests in my own form
I've licked the salt, the bitter, the sweet
Of every encounter, of passion, of heat
Your riotous color, your fragrance, your taste
Have thrilled my senses beyond all haste"
"In your beuaty, I've known the how
Of timeless bliss, this moment of now
Planet Earth are you just
Floating by, a cloud of dust
A minor globe, about to bust
A piece of metal bound to rust
A speck of matter in a mindless void
A lonely spacship, a large asteroid"

Held together with a bit of glue

Do you care, have you a part
In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul.
Planet Earth, gentle and blue
With all my heart, I love you."

Call me on the Night Line - Hee!
Can't get enough (Call me, baby!)

Whisper in my ear
Sending through the fire line
What I'd like to hear"
"She was there just sitting at the table
Thinking now that things won't be the same
And would you like to go with me?
And she aswered no to me
But I guess I've learned my lesson much too soon"

But who knows just what the future brings?
And would she like to go with me?
And she aswered no to me
But I guess I've learned my lesson much too soon"
"Take away this never ending sorrow
Take this lonely feeling from my soul
If only I knew what things bring tomorrow
She'd be sitting here beside me
And my heart would fill with gold
Just"
"I hope to make a change now for the better
Never letting fate control my soul
And hoping that my prayers will see
The day that you'll come back to me
But I guess I've learned my lesson much too soon"
Yes, I guess I've learned my lesson much too soon

"I woke up yesterday
Knowing that I was lost in the past somewhere
I felt my destiny were sad the rain
Going nowhere"

I got song you enchanted me
And the sound of your voice
Make my heart keep turn
To the music got to love that filled my mind"

Is much shorter now that you're here with me

Is my mind I can hear
The band start to play
Hello tomorrow
Goodbye yesterday"

Make me wanna sing
For you only"

Without you darling my life is through
Come on back"
"Why don't you believe me when I say that I love you?
'Cause I'm crazy 'bout you
Wear the face that tells me you think my loving ain't true
I'm all about you
You're my desirer higher, higher everytime I speak your name
That's all I do (that's all I do, that's all I do, that's all I
do)
And the way that I can't sleep at night just proves what I go
through
I'm crazy 'bout you"
"Now the first time that I saw you walking down the street so
pretty
Gone with your bad self
Now you say that I don't love you When it's giving my love pains
It's the hurt and the tension
Girl, it's driving me insane"
"Chorus
You are my, you are my
You are my lovely one
You are my, you are my
You are my lovely one
You are my, you are my
You are my lovely one
You are my, you are my
You are my lovely one!"
"Why don't you believe me, When I say that I am true?
I'm crazy 'bout you"
"I'm here to love and please you, I'll do what you want me to
I'm all about you
Living and hoping, but I'm coping
With these things you put me through
That's all I do
The way that I can't sleep at night
Just proves what I go through
I crazy 'bout you"
"Now the first time that I saw you walking down the street so
pretty
Gone with your bad self
Now you say that I don't love, When it's giving my love pains
It's the hurt and the tension
Girl, it's driving me insane"
"Somebody killed Little Susie
The girl with the tune
Who sings in the daytime at noon
She was there screaming
Beating her voice in her doom
But nobody came to her soon"
"A fall down the stairs
Her dress torn
Oh, the blood in her hair
A mystery so sullen in air
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh, the blood in her hair"
"Everyone came to see
The girl that now is dead
So blind stare the eyes in her head
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said
This girl lived in vain
Her face bear such agony, such strain"
"But only the man from next door
Knew Little Susie, now he cried
As he reached down
To close Susie's eyes
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh, the blood in her hair"
"It was all for God's sake
For her singing the tune
For someone to feel her dispair
To be damned to know hoping is dead
And you're doomed
Then to scream out
And nobody's there"
She knew no one cared
"Father left home
Poor mother died
Leaving Susie alone
Grandfather's soul too had flown
No one to care
Just to love her
How much can one bear
Neglecting the needs in her prayers"
"Neglection can kill
Like a knife in your soul
Oh, it will
Little Susie fought so hard to live
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
So young and so fair"

"There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's climbing up the stairs"
"There's a spirit in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
'Cause they're hiding everywhere"
"Is that scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you, boy
Is this scary for you, baby
Is this scary for you
You know the stranger is you

There's a creep behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there"

Exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me
To see your fantasies"
"Perform before your very eyes
A haunting ghostly treat
The ghoulish trickery
And spirits dancing in the night"
"But if you came to see
The truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start"
"I always feel that
Somebody's watchin' me
I always feel that
Somebody's watchin' me
You're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you"
"You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me"
"You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me"
"If I could tear down these walls
That keep you and I apart
I know I could claim your heart
And our perfect love will start
But girl you just won't approve
Of the things that I do
When all I do is for you
But still you say it ain't cool"
"If there's somebody else
(He can't love you like me)
And he says he'll treat you well
(He can't treat you like me)
And he's buying diamonds and pearls
(He can't do it like me)
And he's taking you all across the world
(He can't trick you like me)"
"So why ain't you feelin' me, she's invincible
But I can do anything, she's invincible
Even when I beg and plead, she's invincible
Girl won't give in to me, she's invincible"
"Now many times I've told you
Of all the things I would do
But I cant seem to get through
No matter how I try to
So tell me how does it seem
That you ain't checking for me
When I know that I could be
More than you could ever dream"

"Now some way I'll have to prove
All that I said I would do
Giving you everything
Fulfilling your fantasy
Then maybe you'll change your mind
And finally give in time
Then I'll be showing you what other men
Are supposed to do for you my baby"
"Yo, mummy stop the refrain, I'm real with mine
All the things that I promise, I'll fulfill in time
The chains and the bracelet got the realest shine (bling)
So many trips she had jetlag, and still be fine (Come on now)
He can trick, but his money ain't long enough
He can spend, but his game ain't strong enough
Now, the way you resisting, this ain't cool It's like nothing seems to worry, she's Invincible"

Whatever it takes
Or how my heart breaks

"Sadness had been
Close as my next of kin
Then Happy came one day
Chased my blues away
My life began when Happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was"
"Happy, that's you
You made my life brand new
Lost as a little lamb was I
Till you came in
My life began when Happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
(Till now)"
"Where have I been?
What life time was I in?
Suspended between time and space
Lonely until
Happy came smiling up at me
Sadness had no choice but to flee
I said a prayer so silently
Let Sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
(Till now)"
"Oooh
Foolish of me, I couldn't see 
The forest for the trees 
You've been so true 
I've been so cruel to you 
Oh, girl please don't leave me"
"Chorus : 
If you stay I'll find a way 
To erase the past 
Baby don't leave me 
Girl don't take your love from me 
Oh girl"
"What can I say to make you stay 
Baby, don't leave me 
You've been so kind 
It blows my mind to know
Oh girl, I really hurt you"
"Chorus : 
Tell me girl, it's not to late 
And you give me a chance 
To make it up to you 
Don't take your love from me 
Girl don't take your love 
Don't take your love"
"Bridge: 
Girl, if you take your love away from me 
I'm gonna be in misery 
Your love is the strength that I lean upon 
How will I make it when it's gone 
Of all the little things I wanted to say.... 
...I really wanted to do
Girl , this time...
Ooh, oh girl I really mean it"
"Chorus : 
So tell me girl, it's not too late

But with proof as sweet as you, noo
Apples peaches and cherries

"Dig it all in, then dig it all out
Stick that pin, make me shout
Lift it up here and cut me there
Botox me, this is the skin I'll wear
Change me and give me morphine again
Give me life, but I might die in your hands
Look at the heart rate falling down
Will somebody tell me why am I damned"
"Doctor, you got the power of skin heal
To make someone fall in love with my peel
Would you sell your soul just to be a doll
So, what do you say, miss, do we got a deal"
"You would do everything for your appearance
Tell me why is it so sacred to you, baby, and
Have you heard of a thing called consequence
You would do everything for your appearance
I wonder how your interior can be so rotten
Only care about your looks, give your brain a chance"

"There is a place we'll go,
Where there is mostly quiet;
Flowers and butterflies,
A rainbow lives beside it."
"And from a velvet sky,
A summer storm;
You can feel the coolness in the air
But you're still warm,
And then a mighty roar
Will start the sky to cryin';
But not even lightening
Will be frightening to my lion."
"And with no fear inside,
No need to run, no need to hide,
You're standing strong and tall,
You're the bravest of them all
If on courage we must call,
Then just keep on tryin'
And tryin' and tryin'-
You're a lion,
In your own way, be a lion."
Come on, be a lion!
I'm standing strong and tall!
You're the bravest of them all!
If on courage you must call-
Keep on trying and...
Trying and trying...
I'm a lion!
In my own way, I'm a lion!

"I dreamed I saw a girl
Oh, so beautiful to me
Her eyes shine like the stars
Is she revealed herself to me?"
"She never said a word
As she smiled and danced for me
And then she disappeared
No I'm left with memories"
"I know this might sound strange
But I'm trying to explain
How an angel came to me"
"Whoa
She came
Yes
She did"

And her timing so divine
I know this was a dream
But could this girl be mine"

But sometimes dreams do come true
I'm hopelessly in love
With someone I never knew"
"I know this might sound strange
Still I'm trying to explain
How an angel came to me"

So delightful
The girl of my dreams
Impossible it seems"

I don't know
Oh
I don't know
No
I don't know"

How an angel came to me"

Too blind to see
I turned my back
On all your needs
What a price
I almost let you get away"

Without your love

And my forever starts today"

"I took my baby on a river boat cruise
And she was well aware
I was excited about the way the things could have been
As in if I don’t care"
"I want a face no one can recognize, in disguise
Someone called my name
They thought of taking pictures, autographs, then they grab
My joy had turned to pain"
"Father always told me: You won’t live a quiet life

You pay the price of fame (price of fame)
Father never lies
My father never lies (price of fame)
My father never lies (price of fame)
So don’t be feelin’ this way, boy"
"I’d like to take sometime and get away, then they’ll say
Is that the boy still alive? 
They make you start taking pills, what a thrill
Only the strong survive
Father always told me: You won’t live a quiet life
They start to wonderin’ where have you been
I feel their envious looks at me
Their mistaken jealousy
Then stand here in my shoes
And get a taste of my blues"
"It’s the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don’t you ever complain?
It’s the price of fame, it’s the price of fame

She only knows how low that she can go
She speaks the lines that can control my mind

Only for me, then spoke with her body
Her only goal is just to take control
And I can't believe that I can't tell her no"

And start doin' without you, and stop talkin' about you
And what will she say?
She will say I was the man that got away"
"I can't blame her
I thought it was love, but it's game huh?
When you're dealing with the emotions, it's pain ma
Take a closer look when your dealing with a stranger

It won't heal from Pepsi they see

So bad that even hell disowned it
Every single step was trouble
For the fool who stumbled on it
Eyes within the dark were watchin'
I felt the sudden chill of danger
Something told me keep on walkin'
Told me I should not have gone there"

A room forever I'll remember
She stared as though I should have known her
Tell me what's your pain or pleasure
Every little thing you find here

Loneliness or hearts on fire
I am here to serve all masters"

When there's no love in your life
Unmerciful is the night
When you just can't stop this feeling
It's torture
It's torture
It's torture"

No, no, of the face I keep on seeing
Was she real or am I dreaming
Did the sound of your name
Turn a wheel
Start a flame in me (ooh)"

Without your love in my life
Alone I walk in the night
And I just can't stop this feeling
It's torture

When there's no love in your life
Unmerciful is the night

I was asleep and tired
She came inside my prima donna
The girl is my heavenly prize"

Telling me the words, that's right
Telling me things I do about her

Happy Birthday Lisa"
Yeah

"There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood upon the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
I know this place is doomed
Because now it's haunting me"
"I don't understand it
Don't understand it"
"There's a thumping in the floor
There's a creep behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin nearly open
Where a restless soul is floating"
"Don't understand it

"And who gave you the right to scare my family
And who gave you the right to shake my baby, she needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree"

Shot an arrow in me
Tell me are you the ghost of jealousy
The ghost of jealousy"

"This is it, here I stand
I'm the light of the world, love you grand
Got this love I can feel
And I know yes for sure it is real"
"And it feels as though I've seen your face a thousand times
And you said you really know me too yourself
And I know that you have got addicted with your eyes
But you say you gonna live it for yourself"
"I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan
I never thught that I would be your lover
C'mon baby, just understand"

I'm the light of the world, run away
We can feel, this is real
Every time I'm in love that I feel"

And you tell me that you've seen my face before.
And you said to me you don't want me hanging round
Many times, wanna do it here before"

Is walk away and pass me by
Don't acknowledge my smile
When I try to say hello to you, yeah"

Is not answer my calls
When I'm trying to get through
Keep me wondering why
When all I can do is sigh"
I just wanna touch you
"I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you tonight
You give me butterflies inside, inside and I"

Is that I must be dreaming
Can't be real

"There comes a time when we heed a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
And it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all"
"We can't go on pretending day by day
That someone, somewhere, will soon make a change
We are all a part of God's great big family
And the truth, you know
Love is all we need"

"Como la brisa
Tu voz me acaricia
Y pregunto por ti
Cuando amanece
Tu amor aparece
Y me hace feliz"
"Me conoces bien
Y sabes tambien
Que nadie te querra
Como yo"
"Tu me haces sentir
Deseos de vivir,
Junto a ti por siempre
Tu amor es mi suerte"
"Tu voz me llama
Tu eres quien gana
En mi corazon
Porque me has dado
Algo sagrado
Con tu pasion"
"Me conoces bien
Y sabes tambien
Que no puedo vivir sin tu amor
Y cuando no estas
No hay felicidad"
"Mi vida no es vida
Si tu te vas"
"Todo mi amor eres tu
Todo mi amor eres tu
Cuando no estas
No hay quien me de lo
Que das tu"
Pues todo mi amor eres tu
"Noche de estrellas
Haz que me quiera
Como a ella yo
De madrugada
Ven que te espera
Todo mi amor"
"Soy joven, lo se
Pero siento que
Te quiero y solo
Vivo por ti"
"Me conoces bien
Y sabes tambien
Que yo no puedo
Vivir sin tu amor"
"Todo mi amor eres tu
Ooh
Todo mi amor eres tu
Cuando no estas
No hay quien me de lo
Que das tu"
Pues todo mi amor lo eres tu
"Cambiaremos al mundo mañana
Cantaremos sobre lo que fue
Y diremos adios a la tristeza
Es mi vida y
Quiero estar junto a ti"
"Todo mi amor eres tu
(now baby, oh)
Todo mi amor eres tu
(if I ain't stop!)"
"Cuando no estas
No hay quien me de lo que das tu
Todo mi amor eres tu
Todo mi amor eres tu"
"Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But I have not the words here to explain
Gone is the grace for expressions of passion
But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain
To tell you how I feel
But I am speechless, speechless
That's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real
When I'm with you I am lost for words, I don't know what to say
My head's spinning like a carousel, so silently I pray"
"Helpless and hopeless, that's how I feel inside
Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side
When I'm with you I am in the light where I cannot be found
It's as though I am standing in the place called Hallowed Ground
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real
I'll go anywhere and do anything just to touch your face
There's no mountain high I cannot climb
I'm humbled in your grace"
"Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away, and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless"
"Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But in your presence I am lost for words
Words like, "I love you.""
"The way she came into the place
I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl"
"The way she moved
Her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion"
"As she stalked the room
I could feel the aura
Of her presence
Every head turned
Feeling passion and lust"
"The girl was persuasive
The girl I could not trust
The girl is bad
The girl is dangerous"
"I never knew, but I was walking the line
Come go with me, I said I have no time
And don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone
My baby cries she left me standing alone"
"She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me"
"She came at me in sections
With the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her
Web of sin, a touch, a kiss
A whisper of love
I was at the point, of no return"
"Deep in the darkness of passions insanity
I left taken by lusts
Strange inhumanity
The girl was persuasive
The girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous"
"I never knew but I was living in vain
She called my house
You said: You know my name
(She caught me)
And don't you pretend you never did me before
(Don't you, don't you do it)
With tears in her eyes my baby walked out the door"
"She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me"
"Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous"
"I have to pray to God
'Cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damned lover
Friend of mine"
"I cannot sleep alone at night
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope till it's all right
You and your manipulations
You hurt my baby"
"And then it happened
She touched me
For the lips of a strange woman
Drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was smoother than oil
But her inner spirit as sharp
As a two-edged sword
But I loved it
'Cause it's dangerous"
"Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me"
"Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me"
"Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me"
"Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous"
"I have to pray to God
'Cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damned lover
Friend of mine"
My baby
"Baby
Love never felt so good
And I'd doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me"
"Oh, baby
Love never felt so fine
And I'd doubt if it's never mine
Not like you hold me, hold me"
"And the night is gonna be just fine
Gotta fly, gotta see, I can't wait
I can't take it"
"'Cause, baby

Not like you hold me, hold me"
"Oh, baby

"I just want to lay next to you for awhile
You look so beautiful tonight
Your eyes are so lovely
Your mouth is so sweet
A lot of people misunderstand me
That's because they don't
Know me at all
I just want to touch you
And hold you
I need you
God I need you
I love you so much"
"Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came"

I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever

At your call
I hear harps
And angels sing"

To sorrow"

"As I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do, so I stopped and got out
And looked down, I noticed I got a flat"
"So I walked out, parked the car like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around, there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling, like a mist"
"I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog a woman appeared
She said, "don't you worry, my friend, I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there""
"Woah, oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name"
"As she took me right through the fog
I seen a beautiful city appear
A where kids are playing and people are laughin' and smilin'
And nothing to fear"
"She said, this is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness

"Once all alone
I was lost in a world of strangers
No one to trust
On my own, I was lonely
You suddenly appeared
It was cloudy before but now it's all clear
You took away the fear
And you brought me back to the light"

"Tell the angels no, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you
That's the chance I'll take
Baby, I'll stay, Heaven can wait
No, if the angels took me from this earth
I would tell them bring me back to her
It's a chance I'll take, maybe I'll stay
Heaven can wait"
You're beautiful, you're wonderful, incredible, I love you so
"You're beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you, girl, it's incredible
And I don't know what I'd do, if I can't be with you
The world could not go on
So every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn't wanna go if I can't see your face, can't hold you close
What good would Heaven be
If the angels came for me? I'd tell them no"

"Unthinkable
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you'd be moving on
I'd turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Can't stand to see nobody kissing, touching her
Couldn't take nobody loving you the way we were
What good would Heaven be
If the angels come for me I'd tell them no"
"No, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
I don't want nobody else to hold you

"I met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone
And so was I, so I asked her for her name
She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that was really into me"
"She said she didn't have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can (she was lovin' me)
She told me she was all alone
Sad at home, she didn't have no phone (she was wantin' me)
She said just to give her a page
Fifty-nine was the code she gave (she was lovin' me)
She lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me
Yeah"

She said that it would never end
Tried to get me any way she can (she was wantin' me)
She lied to you, lied to me
'Cause she got a family, family
Yeah"
Why? No, alright
"I didn't know she was already spoken for
'Cause I'm not that kind of man

Much brighter than tomorrow"

Will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in
Will shine again in grace

Wound this Earth, crucify its soul
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly, be God's glow"
"We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart I feel
You are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together, we'll cry happy tears"

Into plowshares
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place"

It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right"
"As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind?
Pretending not to see their needs"

And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know"

It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me
Pretending that they're not alone?"

Somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream (washed-out dream)
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me"

You gotta get it right, while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart (you can't)
Then you close your mind (close your, your mind)"
"(That man, that man) I'm starting with the man in the mirror
(That man, that man) oh, yeah

Stand up, stand up and lift yourself now (man in the mirror)
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know (change)
Make that change"

Aaow!
"So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Every time I tried to find him
There were no clues, they’re behind him
And they end up never knowing
Who’s the suspect or what to expect
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidations"

And something evil's lurkin' in the dark

And realize there's nowhere left to run

You're out of time"

The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell"

I can't take it, 'cause"
"Baby, every time I love you
In and out of my life

I said: Let me see you move

"And the night, that is good
Gotta fly, gotta see, can't believe
I can't take it, 'cause"

"(So good) love never felt so good
(So good) love never felt so good (never felt so good)
Yeah, yeah, never felt so good
Uh, uh, never felt so God"
"They told him: Don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear
The fire's in their eyes
And their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it"
"You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man (oh)
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad"

Just beat it (beat it) (uh)"
"They're out to get you
Better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive? Better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it (oh)"
"You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life
This ain't no truth or dare (oh)
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you
Then they'll tell you: It's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad"
"Just beat it (beat it), beat it (beat it)
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right"

"You'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?"
"I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time, you won't seduce me"
"She's saying: That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need"
"She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says: There's no turning back
She trapped me in her heart"
"Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Let me be"
"Oh, no
Oh, no
Oh, no"
"She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan
After the curtain comes down"
"She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree"
"She's saying: That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt"
"And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star"
"Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana"
"Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana"
"Diana
Diana
Dirty Diana
It's Diana-iana-iana
Come on"
"She said: I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired, you see
But I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me?"
"I said: My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright"
"Diana walked up to me
She said: I'm all yours tonight
At that, I ran to the phone
Saying: Baby, I'm alright"
"I said: But unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key
She said: He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me"
"Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana"
"Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on"
"Come on (ah, don't you touch me)
Come on (ah, don't you touch me)
Come on (ah, don't you touch me)
Come on (ah, don't you touch me)
Come on"
"Come on
Come on
Come on
Come on"
"Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be?
You're not here with me"
"You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold"
"Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away?
Something whispers in my ear and says"
"That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone"
"'Lone, 'lone
Why? 'Lone"
"Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms"
"I can hear your prayers
Your burdens, I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin"
"Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away?
Something whispers in my ear and says"
"That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone"
"Oh, whisper three words and I'll come runnin', flyin'
And, girl, you know that I'll be there
I'll be there"
"You are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart"
"You are not alone (you are not alone)
I am here with you (I am here with you)
Though you're far away (though you're far away)
I am here to stay
But you are not alone (you are always in my heart)
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone (not alone, oh)"
"You are not alone, you are not alone
Say it again
You are not alone, you are not alone
Not alone, not alone"
"If you just reach out for me, girl
In the morning, in the evening
Not alone, not alone
You and me, not alone, oh"
"Together, together
Not not being alone
Not not being alone"
"She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said: Don't mind, but what do you mean: I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round"
"She told me her name was Billie Jean, as she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round"
"People always told me: Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girl's hearts
My mother always told me: Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do, 'cause the lie becomes the truth"
"The Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son"
"For forty days and forty nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
(Do think twice, do think twice)"
"She told: My baby, we danced 'til three
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo: My baby cried
His eyes were like mine
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby"
"People always told me: Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
But she came and stood right by me
Just to smell her sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room"
"The Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son"
"The Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son"
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
"The Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
(No, she is not just my baby)
But the kid is not my son"
"She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
(You know what you did)
She says he is my son
(Breaking my heart, babe)
She says I am the one"
"The Billie Jean is not my lover
The Billie Jean is not my lover
The Billie Jean is not my lover
The Billie Jean is not my lover
(Call me, Billie Jean)
The Billie Jean is not my lover
(She is not at the scene)"
The Billie Jean is not my lover
"My life will never be the same
'Cause, girl, you came and changed
The way I walk
The way I talk"
"I cannot explain the things I feel for you
But, girl, you know it's true
Stay with me, fulfill my dreams
And I'll be all you need"
"Feels so right (girl)
I've searched for the perfect love all my life
All my life
Feels like I (like I)
Have finally found a perfect love this time (see)
And I finally found, come on, girl"
"You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own, I give (you rocked my world)
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (you rocked my world)"
"You rocked my world, you know you did (girl)
And everything I own I give (I want you, girl)
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine"
"In time, I knew that love would bring
This happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I waited patiently"
"Girl, you know it seems
My life is fully complete
Our love is true because of you
Keep doing what you do"
"Think that I
Finally, found the perfect love
I've searched for all my life (searched for all my life)
Think I'd find
Such a perfect love that's awesomely, so right (whoa, girl)"
"You rocked my world, you know you did (come on)
And everything I own I give (come on, come on, come on)
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find (girl)
Someone like you to call mine (you rocked my world)"
"You rocked my world, you know you did (you rocked my world)
And everything I own I give (girl, girl, girl)
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (girl)"
"You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine"
"You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine"
"Girl, I know that this is love
I felt the magic's all in the air
And girl, I'll never get enough
That's why I always have to have you here"
"You rocked my world, you know you did (you rocked my world)
And everything I own I give
(Look what you did to me baby, yeah)
The rarest love (yeah, yeah), who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine (you rocked my world)"
"You rocked my world, you know you did (know you did, baby)
And everything I own, I give ('cause you rocked my world)
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine"
"You rocked my world
(You rocked my world, you know you did)
The way you talk to me
The way you're lovin' me
The way you give it to me"
"(You rocked my world, you know you did)
Give it to me, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh
(You rocked my world, you know you did)"
"You rocked my world
You rocked my world
You rocked my world
You rocked my world
Come on, girl"
"You rocked my world, you know you did (come on, girl)
And everything I own, I give (baby, baby, baby)
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine"
"You rocked my world, you know you did
And everything I own, I give
The rarest love, who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine"
